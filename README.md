# RAG Application with Streamlit

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using Streamlit. It processes uploaded text documents, builds a vector database using FAISS, and allows users to ask questions about the content of the documents.

## Features
- Upload text files and split them into chunks.
- Generate embeddings using OpenAI and store them in a FAISS vector database.
- Query the content using a GPT-3.5-turbo-powered RetrievalQA pipeline.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- LangChain
- FAISS
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
